ESCAPE FROM THE INVERTED MOUNTAIN is the digital archive of the reclusive polyartist, writer, and musician Kelvin Pittman, seen here in a rare public performance in Baltimore MD, circa the winter of 2013 c.e.

Kelvin maintains a blogging instance at the other EFTIM [dat://ee38a18d452342eececd0172d9d9d476d9e35188a33f31cb39304468bf4cea0d], which requires the <A HREF="https://beakerbrowser.com">Beaker browser</A> to see (until he can ‘fix’ that, if indeed he will ever want to).

Kelvin lives something something something Earth something something.
