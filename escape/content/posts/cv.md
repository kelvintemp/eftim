_Let’s consider this a CV of sorts; not what’s been done to stay alive, but what’s been done to give life meaning - any irreverence on the part of the author is entirely intended for the purposes of humor._


##	VISUAL ART/PRINT 

### _The Obvious_: San Francisco Bay Area — _Temporary Sculptures_
###### JUNE 1997 - SEPTEMBER 1999
A series of public sculptures constructed from found material such as plastic milk crates, cardboard boxes, street signs, flower pots, newspaper, discarded steel-belted radials, shoes... All sculptures were constructed spontaneously and left to the elements or casual disassembly.

### **_INTERRUPT_** zine: S.F./Oakland CA/Portland OR — _Contributor, Editor, Publisher/Distributor_
###### JULY 1998 - MAY 2004
**INTERRUPT** was a zine of comics, poetry, prose and doodles, produced in the now-classic ‘Xerox’ style, made in conjunction with then-friend and bandmate Kyp Malone; a total of six issues were produced, with runs of issues usually numbering in the low twenties. The last issue, a twelve page, three-color spectacular, had a run of exactly ten copies. All this is to say: if there is a single remaining intact issue of this zine anywhere on earth, I would be very surprised. And _maybe_ embarrassed. 

### **_Improvisation as an Aspect of Community_**: Portland OR — _Editor, Contributor, Distributor_
###### OCTOBER 2002 - SEPTEMBER 2007
A monthly calendar of improvised/new music shows, dance/movement performances, and the occasional recommended visual arts exhibit in Portland, OR. Was  maintained by Scott Smith as a website or a tumblr after an abortive print run, I think.

### **_MAJI_**: Oakland CA — _Editor-in-chief, contributing editor, cartoonist, printer, distributor_
###### DECEMBER 2017 - JUNE 2018
**_MAJI_**_: Oakland’s AfroFuturist Newspaper_ was a monthly tabloid-sized AfroFuturist-minded newspaper started by this kid Akande X, artist Alan Clarke, and myself, subsequently losing Alan and gaining D. Scott Ortega-Nanos, Avé-Ameenah Long, and Shani Easley as contributors. Originally planned for a much longer run (one year ~ 12 issues), then truncated to a six-issue run, of which four were completed, printed, promoted, and distributed (five was compiled and completed, but remains unprinted, six, "The Comics Issue", had two comics for it, not really enough to print) - **THE OCTAVIA BUTLER ISSUE**, issue four, ended up being our last. There _was_ a website, but it’s gone now. This is one of the projects I’m the proudest of having contributed to, despite the fact that it all ended so poorly. Great beginning, frustrating middle, bummer end/non-end.

##	SOUND ART

### Mesmer, ~L.A./S.F. CA — Guitar, "Vocals"
###### JULY 1995 - MAY 1998
We were the band that other bands liked, because we were weird on a budget. Kessel Crockett played ever-shifting rhythmic patterns, and Daron Key and I limited ourselves to highbrow skronk  and tone colors via one guitar pedal apiece. No one non-musical was ‘into’ us. Two tapes, a seven-inch, a CD and a (still-unreleased) LP later, we amicably called it quits.

### Control-R Workshop, Oakland CA — Percussion, Guitar, Alto and Tenor Saxophones, Tapes, Vocals, Friction, Trumpet, Violin
###### AUGUST 1998 - JANUARY 2001
Both of the guitarists from Mesmer + Randy Lee Sutherland = AMM-like goods. Again, another band whose main proponents were other musicians, only this time said proponents rocked the ‘lowercase’ to ‘fire music’ spectrum. The group continued on without me until 2006, I believe.

### Rocket Science and the Nigger Loving Faggots, Oakland/S.F. CA — Drumset, Guitar
###### SEPTEMBER 1998 - JANUARY 1999
Improvised rock duo with Kyp Malone (pre-TV On The Radio, Rain Mountain). Very high energy, though I’ve been told that there’s a track on one of our two records that’s great to fall asleep to. Kyp named the band, which was quickly acronymized by S.F. hipsters to RSNLF (everyone else just asked about “Rocket Science”). 

### Super Unity (Super Duppity), Portland OR — Percussion, Guitar, Alto and Tenor Saxophones, Tapes, Vocals, Friction, Trumpet, Violin, Movement, Electronics
###### APRIL 2001 - JANUARY 2005
_Super Unity_ was myself, Joe Foster, Bryan Eubanks and Jean-Paul Jenkins. Super Unity was improvised, absurdist, serious, self-indulgent, restrained, dynamic, stilted, woozy, full, epic, leaden, childish and severe. 

_Super Duppity_ was...us, plus whomever we could find, whoever could play an instrument and show up; loud and wild and fierce and quiet and quick and ragged. Everything we did was interesting in its own right conceptually, I think, and on some level seemed to _genuinely upset people_. 

### Shitknife, Portland OR — Drumset
###### SEMI-OCCASIONALLY IN 2003
Bryan and I liked the urban legend of the escaping First Nations person and the shitknife (not, as you might think, a bad and hence ‘shit’ knife, but an _actual_ knife made of _actual_ shit) so much we named a punk outfit after it. 
It was hard to get gigs with the moniker Shitknife. 


### The Owl In Daylight, Portland OR — Saxophones, Compositions
###### 2003 - 2005 
Graphic scores + all the Portland improvisors available at the time = one mind-melting house show. Music so upsettingly chaotic the violinist (Caroline Buchalter, pre-Strangers Die Every Day)  left the stage after playing through the score. 

### Portland Bike Ensemble, Portland OR — Bicycle, Street Sweeper Blade, Contact Microphone
###### JULY 2003 - DECEMBER 2006
A joyous uproar disturbed only by in-band squabbles and too too too so many lineup changes. And yes, we played our bicycles. More than a few releases, on CD, vinyl, and cassette. Two of the most baffling tours I’ve ever been on.

### Thee Oregon Artificial Limb Company, Portland OR — Alto and Tenor Saxophones
###### SPRING 2006 - FALL 2008
With Bob Jones (Frankie Rose, Gospel of Mars) on stand-up bass, and Mark E. Kaylor (CexFucx, AU, Hammer of Hathor) on drums, we were an undeniably upbeat experimental ‘_fweee-jasss_’ trio. One release, a bunch of really weird and fun shows, and a residency at a bar for a summer. Originally featured JP Jenkins on guitar as a foursome under the name ‘Birthdays’ (because our inaugural show was on one of our birthdays, and I believe the second show had a birthday-haver in the audience - everyone has a birthday!), and that didn’t work out, so the **Limb Company** was born.

### TANDEM, Portland/Wheeler OR — Tenor saxophone
###### 2006 - 2007
TANDEM was Whitney Woolf (Portland Bike Ensemble) on cracked electronics, and myself on sax. It was very, very squirrelly and squelchy and hilarious. We recorded a CD, **_THIS IS WHEN WE WENT TO THE BEACH AND IT WAS COLD_**, for a micro-label and it never came out. I dunno. Found the master recently, though. Only played out a few times, and each time was awesome and weird.

### Silver Creme, Portland OR — Electric Guitars
###### ~ 2007 - 2008
Silver Creme was Nick Bindeman (TUNNELSS, Eternal Tapestry) on guitars, Megan Remy/M. Remy (U.S. GIRLS) on drums, and me. Another improvised rock outfit, only way more linear and melodic. Kind of like surf music for hydrophobes. Lots of fun. Miss those kids. One tour and one release, which is now considered a collectors item.

### Recluse, Baltimore MD — Tenor Saxophone
###### 2013
A duo consisting of myself and Paul Neidhart, percussionist extraordinaire, because we were both recluses and playing together at the time. Three shows total, I think.

### M PHANTOM, Baltimore MD/Philadelphia PA — Tenor Saxophone
###### 2011 - 2012
A duo consisting of myself and dancer/thinker Asimina Chremos, primarily  concerned with ideas about space, movement, ambient and environmental sounds, and hauntology to a certain degree. Performances: one at a house show, one at a community center, one at HIGH ZERO 2012, and one ‘telecast’ to a dance festival in Chicago from Asimina’s living room.

### IKUSASA, Oakland CA — Tenor Saxophone
###### 2018
Akande X on electric bass, D. Scott Ortega-Nanos on violin, myself on saxophone, just improvising away. Originally started with a Ghanian marimba player who stopped showing up or returning phone calls, and I can’t remember his name anyway. Played two shows. Name is Swahili for “get got”, as in “That motherfucker needs to _get got_.”

### LURK/CREEPS, Oakland CA — Tenor Saxophone
###### 2017-2018
Randy Sutherland (saxophones), Paul Costuros ([TOTAL SHUTDOWN], drums), and me, playing thready, thorny free-jazz type stuff. Two public performances and some emails.

##	OTHER STUFF

#### YR PEGASUS, Portland OR — Composer
###### Sometime in 2003, I think 
I composed an “opera”. It ran the course of Reed College Renn Fayre 2003. Chairs were suspended from walls. We all met the mushroom brownie lady on the last day. Everyone but me got super drunk the first night. I fell off a ladder. Not a total failure, but not one worth getting into too much detail on.

#### Egyptian Tragedy, Seattle WA — Saxophones?
###### ~ 2008?
Tyler Wilcox, Gust Burns and I had a joke band called ‘Egyptian Tragedy’ that never played any music, never practiced, never released anything - but was, for a while, _the funniest goddamn thing to riff on_, so it’s going in this list because I liked it despite existing in name only.
