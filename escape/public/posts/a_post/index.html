<p>That video is a grim reminder of law enforcement’s ridiculous over-response to the very rumor of an encounter with a Black person.</p>

<p>Story time:</p>

<p>In 1998, while I was living in San Francisco, I was pulled over while walking on the corner of 17th and Valencia by two cops, a (white) man and a (possibly Latina) woman. I was stopped, questioned, patted down, and detained (they didn’t cuff me, and I got to sit) because the male cop said I “resembled a suspect they’d been looking for” (read: Black and male with a head of hair). It was an odd scene of sorts, because while her hand hovered near her weapon, his never did, and they never drew on me, but they did stand close enough to block or intercept any path or egress or flight.</p>

<h3 id="lore-sum">Lore Sum</h3>

<p>Now I don’t know if the police station on 17th and Valencia is still there (my long-standing rule since having lived in SF for a few miserable years during the dot-com era: I NEVER go to SF unless I have an exceptionally good reason, or I’m getting paid to go there, do something, and leave), but after a breezy 10 min, another (white?) cop, shaped like an upside-down bowling pin (two cops up-top but one on the bottom) ambled across the street with a fresh fax sheet, and gave it to the LEOs who’d stopped me. Who looked at it, and me, and then it again, and then at me again, sheepishly. And then, with a surprising amount of sincerity, they apologized and let me continue on my way. (I don’t know if you’ve ever had a police-person apologize to you for one of their own errors, but I must admit, it is an exquisite experience, one to be savored; not because it doesn’t happen often, because it doesn’t, but because cops hate apologizing. I don’t make rules, just observations.) After they’d apologized, just before I was turning to walk away, I asked to look at the fax, and know what this ‘bad mans’ had been accused of.</p>

<p>The resemblance? “Uh, look, this guy is&hellip;a little bit lighter than me, and his nose is definitely wider, and he has much bigger hair, and fuller lips, and his face is&hellip;wider? Not as narrow as mine. Less cheekbones. That help?”</p>

<p>The crime? Murder. In Long Beach.</p>

<p>There are really only two factors that saved me, three if you count the fact that I didn’t murder anyone in Long Beach, but innocence of the commission a crime isn’t the concern of American cops when dealing with Black people in America, especially men. Factor one was that I was, as could be said, stonededed as a mug, and thereby preternaturally calm. Factor two was the takeaway from when my parents gave me The Talk: “Always be polite, say sir and ma’am and officer, and you will hardly ever have any problems.”</p>

<p>What does this have to do with the story above? Because what I am not saying is that my parent’s strategy would have worked in the above case: I totally got lucky. What I am saying, though, is that I have, in some small part, been there, minus the selfless bravery of the woman filming all this horribleness. and I’m glad to see everyone make it out alive today.</p>

<p>Also: That dude looks pretty good for 47.</p>
